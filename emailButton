so this file contains the email button which is currently inside the helloApplication.java i am putting that button's code here becuase for obvious reasons it will not be on the main page of the website 

If you want this to open from helloApplication, just add a button like:

java
Copy
Edit
Button emailBtn = new Button("Email");
emailBtn.setOnAction(e -> {
    EmailPage emailPage = new EmailPage();
    try {
        emailPage.start((Stage) ((Node) e.getSource()).getScene().getWindow());
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
});
